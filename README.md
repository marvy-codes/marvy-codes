## 👋 Hey, I'm Marvellous 
### 🧠 I'm a Smart Contract Auditor | solidity and Move
A software engineer with 5+ years in the technology space, Currently staring at smart contracts until one of us breaks.
Smart contract auditor focused on DeFi architecture, invariant violations, vault accounting, and value-flow bugs.
Currently deep-diving complex systems across Sherlock, competitive audits, and independent research in major DEFI and Security areas aiming for top-tier audit performance.

### 📊 Audit Journey
35+ competitive audit contests participation and 8+ Medium and High findings across protocols also Multiple High-severity logic issues identified. Deep architectural reviews of 7k+ nSloc systems and 3 Move private audit engagements

<!-- ### 🛡️ Security Work in Contests
Recent protocol reviews include:
- Burve Protocol (multi-token closure & value engine)
- Plaza Finance (programmable derivatives)
- Yieldoor (leveraged LP vault system)
- LayerEdge (tiered staking + Fenwick tree ranking)
- Pareto Dollar (synthetic stablecoin + vault queue)
- ETH0 Beta (wstETH-collateralized synthetic ETH)

I approach audits by:
- Mapping architecture first
- Identifying value entry & exit points
- Testing invariant break scenarios
- Simulating malicious state reachability
- Writing PoC when impact is non-trivial
-->
### 🧪 Tools & Stack
- Move
- Solidity
- Fuzzing
- Foundry (advanced testing + fuzzing)
- EVM bytecode analysis
- Gas optimization review
