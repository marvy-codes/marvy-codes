## 👋 Hey, I'm Marvellous 
### 🧠 I'm a Full-Stack & Blockchain Engineer with Deep Smart Contract Security Expertise
### 🚀 About
I’m a Full-Stack, Blockchain Engineer and Security Researcher with over 5 years of experience building and securing production systems across Web2 and Web3 environments.
My background spans frontend engineering (React, Next.js, TypeScript), backend systems (Node.js, Express, APIs, MongoDB), and blockchain development (Solidity, EVM architecture, Move). I’ve built user-facing applications, backend services, and smart contract systems that bridge on-chain logic with real-world platforms.
In recent years, I’ve specialized in smart contract security and DeFi protocol architecture. I actively audit complex systems, analyze value-flow invariants, vault accounting mechanisms, and protocol-level risk across competitive audit platforms and independent research.

What differentiates me is dual perspective:
- I understand how systems are built.
- I understand how they break.

This allows me to design more secure contracts, more reliable backend systems, and more resilient full-stack applications.

I’m open to roles in:
• Blockchain Development
• Smart Contract Engineering
• Backend Engineering
• Frontend/Web3 Engineering
• Security Engineering

Let’s build secure systems.

### 📊 Audit Journey
25+ competitive audit contests participation and over 10+ Medium and High public findings across protocols also Multiple High-severity logic issues identified. Deep architectural reviews of 7k+ nSloc systems and 2 Move private audit engagements

<!-- ### 🛡️ Security Work in Contests
Recent protocol reviews include:
- Burve Protocol (multi-token closure & value engine)
- Plaza Finance (programmable derivatives)
- Yieldoor (leveraged LP vault system)
- LayerEdge (tiered staking + Fenwick tree ranking)
- Pareto Dollar (synthetic stablecoin + vault queue)
- ETH0 Beta (wstETH-collateralized synthetic ETH)

I approach audits by:
- Mapping architecture first
- Identifying value entry & exit points
- Testing invariant break scenarios
- Simulating malicious state reachability
- Writing PoC when impact is non-trivial
