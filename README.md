## 👋 Hey, I'm Marvellous 
### 🧠 I'm a Full-Stack & Blockchain Engineer with Deep Smart Contract Security Expertise
### 🚀 About
I help teams build secure, scalable blockchain and backend systems that don’t break in production.
From writing and securing Solidity smart contracts to designing APIs and full-stack applications, I ship systems that are both functional and attack-resistant.
I’m a Full-Stack, Blockchain Engineer and Security Researcher with 5+ years of experience building production grade software across Web2 and Web3. I work across:

- Smart contract development (Solidity, EVM, Move)
- Backend systems (Node.js, Express, APIs, MongoDB)
- Frontend applications (React, Tailwind.cssNext.js, TypeScript)

Over the past few years, I’ve specialized in DeFi architecture and smart contract security  analysing invariant violations, vault accounting models, and protocol-level risks across competitive audits and independent research.

I bring both:
- A builder’s mindset — shipping reliable systems
- An attacker’s mindset — stress-testing assumptions

If you’re building blockchain products, DeFi infrastructure, or Web3 applications and need engineering depth with security awareness, let’s connect.

<!-- ### 🛡️ Security Work in Contests
Recent protocol reviews include:
- Burve Protocol (multi-token closure & value engine)
- Plaza Finance (programmable derivatives)
- Yieldoor (leveraged LP vault system)
- LayerEdge (tiered staking + Fenwick tree ranking)
- Pareto Dollar (synthetic stablecoin + vault queue)
- ETH0 Beta (wstETH-collateralized synthetic ETH)

I approach audits by:
- Mapping architecture first
- Identifying value entry & exit points
- Testing invariant break scenarios
- Simulating malicious state reachability
- Writing PoC when impact is non-trivial
-->


### 🧪 Security Tools 
- Gas optimization review
- Manual exploit simulation
- Foundry (advanced testing + fuzzing)
- Invariant & state reachability testing
