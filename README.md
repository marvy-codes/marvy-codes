## 👋 Hey, I'm Marvellous 
### 🧠 I'm a Smart Contract Auditor | solidity and Move
Staring at smart contracts until one of us breaks.

Smart contract auditor focused on DeFi architecture, invariant violations, vault accounting, and value-flow bugs.

Currently deep-diving complex systems across Sherlock, competitive audits, and independent research in major DEFI and Security areas aiming for top-tier audit performance.

### 📊 Audit Journey
35+ competitive audit contests participated
8+ Medium and High findings across protocols
Multiple High-severity logic issues identified
Deep architectural reviews of 7k+ nSloc systems
3 Move private audit engagements

### Public Findings
| # | Date | Provider | Project | Category | Findings |
|---|------|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| 1 | 02.2024 | Guardian | Lending | 1H | Solidity |



### 🧱 Protocol Types I Enjoy Auditing
- Lending / Borrowing markets
- Vault systems & share accounting
- AMMs (constant product + custom curves)
- Staking & reward distribution
- Leveraged LP architectures and systems
- Synthetic stablecoin systems
- Multi-pool value routing designs
- Staking & restaking protocols

### 🛡️ Security Work
Recent protocol reviews include:
- Burve Protocol (multi-token closure & value engine)
- Plaza Finance (programmable derivatives)
- Yieldoor (leveraged LP vault system)
- LayerEdge (tiered staking + Fenwick tree ranking)
- Pareto Dollar (synthetic stablecoin + vault queue)
- ETH0 Beta (wstETH-collateralized synthetic ETH)

I approach audits by:
- Mapping architecture first
- Identifying value entry & exit points
- Testing invariant break scenarios
- Simulating malicious state reachability
- Writing PoC when impact is non-trivial

### 🧪 Tools & Stack
- Solidity
- Foundry (advanced testing + fuzzing)
- EVM bytecode analysis
- Gas optimization review
- Invariant & state reachability testing
- Manual exploit simulation
